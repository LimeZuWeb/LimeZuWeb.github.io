    </p>

    <h2>Interior Themes</h2>
    <p>
    Inside the base Modern Interiors folder there is a sub folder called <b>"1_Interiors"</b>, inside of there pick the size you want (16x16 (Recommended), 32x32, 48x48), inside here there are quite a few folders to choose from depending on your needs:<br>
    </p>
    <p class="text-align-left">
        <b>"Theme_Sorter"</b> Contains all sprites for all themes with each theme being placed in a single .png.<br>

        <br><b>"Theme_Sorter_Shadowless"</b> Same as <b>"Theme_Sorter"</b> except without shadows.<br>

        <br><b>"Theme_Sorter_Black_Shadow"</b> & <b>"Theme_Sorter_Black_Shadow_Singles"</b><br> are variants of the regular folders but with the same shadow hue as what's used in Modern Exteriors (This was added later to aid in compatibility between Modern Interiors & Modern Exteriors).
    </p>

    <h2>Animated Objects</h2>
    <p>
        Some sprites such as doors, fireplaces, tvs, etc that have animations don't appear in the regular Theme Sorter folders, instead they have their own folder titled <b>"3_Animated_objects"</b>, inside of there you can choose the size you want (16x16 (Recommended), 32x32, 48x48), after that all animated objects are supplied as both .gif and .png as a spritesheet. In total there are 313 animated sprites.
    </p>

    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>
        From the base Modern interiors folder is a folder titled <b>"2_Characters"</b>, then from inside there is another folder titled <b>"Character_Generator"</b>, this folder contains everything needed to create any character.
        Characters are built up of 5 pieces, the <b>Body</b>, <b>Eyes</b>, <b>Outfit</b>, <b>Hairstyle</b>, and an optional <b>Accessory</b> such as a beard, backpack, hat, etc.<br>
        <br>To create a character go to each respective character piece and copy each one on top of each other in any art software (<a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>, <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.net</a>, <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/">Piskel</a>, etc) to create a full character
    </p>

    <h3>Character Generator</h3>
    <p>
        We know it can be tedious to manually copy each character piece to create a character, so to fix this problem we've created the <b>Character Generator</b>, this tool allows you to easily create and preview your character by simply selecting dropdowns at the top of the screen.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>User Interface Elements</h2>
    <p>

From the base <b>Modern Interiors</b> folder is a folder titled <b>"4_User_Interface_Elements"</b>, within there are a few types of UI <b>"UI_thinking_emotes"</b> which are mainly used as character thought bubbles,
        <b>"UI"</b> which contains the bulk of the User Interface Elements, it has various things such as a mouse cursor, timers, arrows, etc. Finally there's the <b>"Animated_Spritesheets"</b> folder which contains animated versions of the regular UI
